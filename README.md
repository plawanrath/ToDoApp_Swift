# ToDoApp_Swift
A basic ToDo List created for an iPhone in Swift

This app created, uses a Table View and 2 view controllers. One view controller is to add a task and another is to 
display and delete tasks.
I have created a struct tasks containing the name and description and all tasks are stored as an array of structures.
